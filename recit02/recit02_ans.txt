Question 1:
a,b,c) False

d) True

e,f,g) False

h) True



Question 2:

a)Inherits all methods and attributes from rectangles, but for its
instantiate parameters, it acceps only 1 parameter for length which
is passed onto the Rectangle class using super. Refer to the
recitation02.java code.

b)It allows the values within the Rectangle class to be modified,
violating abstraction principles on encapsulation due to
know-too-much and bad actors can edit these values. The original
class's attributes are also changed, which is always bad.

c)since a square is a specialised form of a rectangle, it still makes
sense for a Square class to inherit from a Rectangle class.
