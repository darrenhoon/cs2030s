//**** Functor (c)
//**** Write your answer below

The functor laws are identity and associativity.
it violates the identity law as 
x.of("the Quick bROwn fox").toString() returns
"xof nwORb kciuQ eht"
but Box.of("the Quick bROwn fox").map(x -> x).toString() returns
"the Quick bROwn fox"

the object's identity is not kept and both do not equal each other.
since the identity law is violated, the Box does not obey the
functor laws.
